# Point Pattern Analysis of the Grocery Stores in California

## 1. Project Overview
In this project, we will be using point pattern analysis (PPA) to determine the grocery stores in California are distributed equitably. Point pattern analysis, in non-technical terms, is the study of spatial arrangements of points in space. This form of analysis helps us understand whether a certain set of spatial data points are distributed normally, in a clustered fashion, randomly, or regularly. For our analysis, we will be using 3 data sets: the grocery stores data set, its corresponding geographical data set (showing polygon coordinates), and the California Population Density data set. The data sets can be found in the following github page: https://github.com/markadut/Data-Science-Fellow-Brown-University.
